## ðŸš€ Projects
### Project 1: musetools
A Python package for reading and analyzing 3D integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopic data-cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. [Link to project](https://github.com/rongmon/musetools)

### Project 2: Flood Prediction
My code for the Kaggle competition that predicts the flooding probability in a certain region based on various factors. I ppplied linear, Ridge, and XGBoost regression in this competition to predict regional flooding probabilities based on environmental factors.
